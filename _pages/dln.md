title: "Digital Literacy Narrative"
---

At 21, I find myself on the cusp of two different worlds: one where handwritten notes and face-to-face meetings dominated daily life, and another, where my entire life seems enveloped by screens, dinging notifications, and an ever-expanding web of interconnected data. Enrolling in an introductory course on Digital Humanities at the university felt like a logical step forward, considering my perpetual relationship with the digital realm.

For daily content creation, I naturally gravitate towards platforms that my peers and I have grown up with. Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok have not only been tools for communication but also for personal expression. From creating quick stories to curating my feed, these platforms have given me rudimentary skills in design, storytelling, and audience engagement. Academically, I've been inclined towards Microsoft Office for years, relying on Word for essays and PowerPoint for presentations. But the university introduced me to Google Workspace. Tools like Google Docs and Slides have transformed my group projects, making real-time collaboration a breeze.

For social interactions, apart from the above-mentioned platforms, WhatsApp and Discord are my go-to apps. Whether it's coordinating with project teams or just catching up with old friends, they serve as a bridge.

My research pursuits as a student frequently involve navigating through scholarly databases like JSTOR and Google Scholar. Mendeley has been invaluable for reference management, helping me keep track of all the articles and papers relevant to my assignments.

For data manipulation and analysis, I've dabbled in Excel, relying on it for basic data visualization and computations. Though, admittedly, I recognize this barely scratches the surface of what is possible in the world of data analytics.

Reflecting critically, I realize that while I've become adept at using many digital tools for personal and academic purposes, I haven’t truly delved deep into understanding the broader implications of the digital shift, nor have I explored the profound potential these tools and platforms hold.

This Digital Humanities course has been an eye-opener. In just a few weeks, I've been introduced to digital archiving and the ethical considerations behind it, the art of digital storytelling, and the potential of text mining in humanities research. I've come to appreciate that digital literacy is not just about being able to use digital tools, but also understanding the societal, ethical, and cultural implications of the digital revolution.

But as much as I’ve learned, there's so much more I aspire to grasp. I want to dive deep into the world of data analytics. I’m eager to explore software like R and Python, often mentioned in our readings, to see how they can aid in digital humanities research. I'm also keen on mastering visualization tools beyond Excel, perhaps Tableau, to better represent and analyze complex datasets.

To sum up, my journey in the Digital Humanities has only just begun. While I've been a passive user of the digital realm, I’m keen to evolve into an active participant, creator, and critical thinker, making the most of the digital tools at my disposal while always being mindful of their broader implications.
